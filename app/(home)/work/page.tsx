          Building an Object Detection Model with Ultralytics YOLO and Roboflow
        </h1>
        <div>
          Object detection is a critical task in computer vision that involves
          identifying and locating objects within an image. One of the leading
          frameworks for object detection is the YOLO (You Only Look Once)
          family, developed by Ultralytics. Combined with Roboflow, a powerful
          tool for managing and augmenting datasets, you can build an efficient
          and effective object detection model. This guide will walk you through
          the process.
