# Detectify

Detectify is a platform that enhances shopping experiences through advanced machine learning and visual AI technologies. Users can upload images or videos to identify corresponding products on Amazon, facilitating seamless product search, recommendations, and direct purchases.

- Currently we are in prototyping mode so the model may not be very much accurate (since it is trained on very small dataset ).
- In order to see the product in action you can see the video demonstration.

## Current Limitations

- Difficulty in identifying and purchasing products featured in video content.
- Lack of seamless integration between video content and e-commerce platforms.
- Large processing time of video content.

## Customer Pain Points

- **Fragmented Experience**: Users face inconvenience switching between video content and shopping platforms.
- **Lack of Personalization & Missed Opportunities**: Absence of direct purchase options leads to missed chances for spontaneous purchases.

## Acknowledgments

- Ultralytics YOLO and Roboflow for their powerful object detection tools.
- Amazon Prime Video for the inspiration behind the X-ray feature.
